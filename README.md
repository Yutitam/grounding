This is an example of using CVXPY to optimize cost in a grid system by considering:
  -The number of conductor rows and columns
  -The grid resistance
The goal is to determine the most cost-effective configuration while satisfying design constraints. This example demonstrates how convex optimization can be applied in electrical system planning.
